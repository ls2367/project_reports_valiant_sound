        <br>
        
        <h3>Narrative past</h3>
        <p>During the last sprint, we used the project's grading program to verify our code and identify the most appropriate next steps. 
        Following this testing phase, we proceeded by coding the about page and the landing page for the donation of each event. 
        Finally, we inserted other visual/strucutral elements to our website (namely: logo, links to the different pages in the footer, ...) </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Project backlog</h3>
        <p> In our <a href="https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/final-project-mgt656-617c59c061450a001b0ff961/reports/cumulative?invite=true">project backlog</a> you will find 3 issues with a total of 21 points, at the present point in time. 
        3 issues for a total of 11 points were not completed in the current sprint and will be postponed to the next one.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Upcoming to-dos</h3>
        <p>Now that we have concluded our third and final sprint, most issues have been closed and the basic functionality of our application is all set up and ready to go. 
        We will continue working on several issues that we believe need further improvements. We have decided that we will not continue with our daily standup meetings. 
        Instead, we will have the final issues open and every developer who has capacity will continue working on them. Moreover, we will meet once per week to 
        discuss questions that might arise when doing so.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we still have to write our final project report. We will do this the week before it is due.</p>
