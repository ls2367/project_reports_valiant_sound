        <h3>Narrative past</h3>
        <p>During the last sprint we concluded the main body of this project´s work. Christian and Nico were working on setting the pages for all 5 events
        while Dayo was working on setting up the RSVP with the backstop of only allowing Yalies to sign up (Harvard booo). Additionally,
        Lisa set up the account for the Matomo account. The tracking of the button cannot take place yet. This has two reasons. Firstly, the Donate button has not been created.
        Secondly, the JS Function is still in development.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Project backlog</h3>
        <p> In our <a href="https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/final-project-mgt656-617c59c061450a001b0ff961/reports/cumulative?invite=true">project backlog</a> you will find 7 issues with a total of 39 points, at the present point in time. All points of all stories are now defined. In our previous sprints we confused "done"
        with "closed". Therefore, it looks like we completed all work in one day (see burndown chart).</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Upcoming to-dos</h3>
        <p>Now that we have concluded our third and final sprint, most issues have been closed and the basic functionality of our application is all set up and ready to go. 
        We will continue working on several issues that we believe need further improvements. We have decided that we will not continue with our daily standup meetings. Instead, we will have
        the final issues open and every developer who has capacity will continue working on them. Moreover, we will meet once per week to 
        discuss questions that might arise when doing so.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we still have to write our final project report. We will do this the week before it is due.</p>

        <h3>Completed stories</h3>
        <p>#20 populate project backlog: As a team, we are aware of all the steps that need to be completed in order to finish the project on time. Most stories for the 3 sprints have been laid out
        </p>
        <p>#21 groom project backlog: As a team, we are aware of the different features that have to be added to the website, entailed by each user story. Furthermore, we are aware of particular one-sided dependencies between the user stories.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Narrative past</h3>
        <p>In this week's sprint we managed to populate the product backlog with a total of 
        9 user stories. We created 3 final project stories which are greater "Kyle" stories. Furthermore, we created
        stories for the timely creation of three sprint reports. We already started experimenting with the CSS and HTML file to try to understand 
        how they are linked together.</p>
        
        <h3>Project backlog</h3>
        <p>In our project backlog you will find 14 new issues to which we assigned a total of 26 points. Beware that so far we only awarded 2 issues the total amount of points. In our
        upcoming sprint planning meeting we will assign points to the remaining issues</p>
        
        
        <h3>Upcoming to-dos</h3>
        <p>Sprint planning meeting on Wednesday, 4pm PT</p> -->
