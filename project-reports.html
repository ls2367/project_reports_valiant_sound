        <h3>Narrative past</h3>
        <p>During the last sprint we concluded the main body of this projectÂ´s work. Christian and Nico were working on setting the pages for all 5 events
        while Dayo was working on setting up the RSVP with the backstop of only allowing Yalies to sign up (Harvard booo). Additionally,
        Lisa set up the account for the Matomo account. The tracking of the button cannot take place yet. This has two reasons. Firstly, the Donate button has not been created.
        Secondly, the JS Function is still in development.</p>
        
        <h3>Project backlog</h3>
        <p> In our project backlog you will find 8 user-stories with a total of 26 points, at the present point in time. The points of four stories are yet to be defined.</p>
        
        <h3>Upcoming to-dos</h3>
        <p>Sprint retrospective meeting cominf up next Sunday. In addition we decided to implement an optional daily Scrum stand-up meeting. Here we want to give our marvlous developers
        Lisa, Dayo Nico & Christian the chance to communicate potential shortcomings to get solutions from the co-developers. 4pm PT</p>

        <h3>Narrative past</h3>
        <p>In this week's sprint we managed to populate the product backlog with a total of 
        9 user stories. We created 3 final project stories which are greater "Kyle" stories. Furthermore, we created
        stories for the timely creation of three sprint reports. We already started experimenting with the CSS and HTML file to try to understand 
        how they are linked together.</p>
        
        <h3>Project backlog</h3>
        <p>In our project backlog you will find 14 new issues to which we assigned a total of 26 points. Beware that so far we only awarded 2 issues the total amount of points. In our
