        <h3>Narrative past</h3>
        <p>During the last sprint we concluded the main body of this projectÂ´s work. Christian and Nico were working on setting the pages for all 5 events
        while Dayo was working on setting up the RSVP with the backstop of only allowing Yalies to sign up (Harvard booo). Additionally,
        Lisa set up the account for the Matomo account. The tracking of the button cannot take place yet. This has two reasons. Firstly, the Donate button has not been created.
        Secondly, the JS Function is still in development.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Project backlog</h3>
        <p> In our <a href="https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/final-project-mgt656-617c59c061450a001b0ff961/reports/cumulative?invite=true">project backlog</a> you will find 7 issues with a total of 39 points, at the present point in time. All points of all stories are now defined. In our previous sprints we confused "done"
        with "closed". Therefore, it looks like we completed all work in one day (see burndown chart).</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Upcoming to-dos</h3>
        <p>Sprint retrospective meeting cominf up next Sunday. In addition we decided to implement an optional daily Scrum stand-up meeting. Here we want to give our marvlous developers
        Lisa, Dayo Nico & Christian the chance to communicate potential shortcomings to get solutions from the co-developers. 4pm PT</p>
